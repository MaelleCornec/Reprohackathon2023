MissingOutputException in line 27 of /home/ubuntu/Reprohackathon2023/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 10 seconds:
index/indexation
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 3 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 3
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
